\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

The remaining of the paper is organized as follows; in \ref{probstat} the localization problem addressed in this work is described, and the system dynamics are introduced along with the measurement setup. In \ref{obsdes} the structure of the proposed hybrid observer is introduced, and the actual design is detailed. In this section simulation results are also presented, in order to coherently extend the results provided in \cite{Oliva03}. In \ref{expset} the experimental setup considered for the observer validation on the Jackal rover is detailed. Furthermore, the actual control architecture implementation is described, along with the final estimation loop. A short stability analysis will be provided as well, in order to ensure convergence of the estimation error. Lastly, in \ref{res}, the performance of the observer will be extensively investigated on the Jackal test bench. More specifically, two experiments will be carried out; the first assessing the observer performance on standard paths for the rover. The second will assess the observer performance also in case of a more realistic scenario in which the rover pushes objects around it to achieve earth movementation. In \ref{conc} conclusions are drawn and future directions are proposed.
